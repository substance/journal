# Features

- Write and publish articles on an integrated web-platform using Subtance editing technology
- Collaboration (write together, esp. review stuff)
- very easy to deploy (runs on every linux system)
- no dependencies on external services (no facebook, twitter integration, yes you heard right)

## Future Challenges

- How can we combine individually owned instances but still can announce some articles to be globally available. 
- Decentralized search index / routing?

For example: there are 20 different substance journals hosted by different people, they also run different versions. can there be a public index about 

## Roadmap

### 0.1.0

- Basic editing (text, headings)
- Remarks (make Notes during editing)
- User management
  - no public signup
  - new users are created from the control panel
  - everybody is an admin
- SQLite only (using Knex.js query builder, so we can switch to other SQL databases)
- Simple Reader view (non-interactive -> mobile friendly)
- Server-side rendering so google can easily index the page

### 0.2.0

- Support for Images
- Control about publishing changes (See Issue #2)


### 0.3.0

- Reader comments (how do they authenticate? maybe it makes sense to user twitter/facebook auth here)
- Full Text Search on text fragment level using Elastic Search or Lunr.js (https://github.com/olivernn/lunr.js)
- Integration of [Lens Browser](https://medium.com/@_mql/self-host-a-scientific-journal-with-elife-lens-f420afb678aa) interface
- Commenting requires additional user interface, and works best in a two-column mode, so we probably will show a collaborate button to switch from reading to collaborating mode.

### 0.4.0

- Subject tagging based on selections in the doc
- Expose subjects in the browser interface
